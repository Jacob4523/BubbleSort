## Bubble Sort App

Welcome to the Bubble Sort App!
This app will take a file that contains integers (each on a separate line) and sort them, or an integer to create an array with random integers that is then sorted.

## Inputting a File

Inputting a file containing integers (each on a separate line) will take the array and sort them, saving the result to arraySorted.txt.

## Inputting an Integer

Inputting an integer will create an array containing the number of elements equal to the integer you inputted.

Each element will be a random integer from 0-100, and the result is saved to arrayRandom.txt.

Afterwards, the resulting array will be sorted and saved into a separate file named arraySorted.txt.

## Sample File

Array1.txt has been provided as a sample file to input.
